Signals is a survey floated every 6 months. Employees answer questions about their manager, workgroup (i.e. everyone else reporting to same manager) and general working conditions. 

#### Things to keep in mind
- Most feedback is about your manager, not triad. Good signals scores reflect well on your manager, bad signals scores reflect poorly on your manager. Signals is not the right place to give feedback about triad issues. 
- If you don't know enough to answer something, skip the question instead of giving a medium rating.
- Signals are taken pretty seriously by leadership, so spend some time filling it out properly.
- Your manager is only able to see aggregated responses if the have at least 5 people who filled out the survey. Questions with text fields are shown without names, but you should be careful not to reveal information that could reveal your ID.
