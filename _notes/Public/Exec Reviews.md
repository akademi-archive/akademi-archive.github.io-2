Some things to think about

### Types of reviews
- Project status update
- Inform/update
- Plan approval
- Product review/wallow
- Major decision needed
- Strategy decision

### Know your audience
- Put yourself in the exec's shoes. What are they most worried about? "Do I need to worry about this? Or does the team have it under control, and I can worry about other things?"
- What do they tend to dig into?
- What is their dysfunction?
- What do they think your dysfunction is?

### Be clear on what _you_ want out of this review
- Get support or approval?
- Hear context and advice?
- Inform?
- Get decision/clarity on priorities?

### Put the ask up front
- If you're going to ask for something, don't let it be a surprise at the end. Ask for it up front and then explain why you need it.

### Demonstrate healthy relationships
- Show healthy collaboration within team and with other teams
- Make sure partners have reviewed the deck and their feedback has been accounted for beforehand. Don't end up saying something not representative of other team's stance.

### Know your material
- If you don't, make sure the people who do are in the room with you.

### Take ownerships of problems, follow up on them
- Something isn't working right? Address it.
