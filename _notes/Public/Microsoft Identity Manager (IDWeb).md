IDWeb lets employees manage Distribution and Security groups - you can remove yourself from a group, or ask to be added. If you are getting spam from a DG and don't want to receive it, you can go to IDWeb and remove yourself.

### Distribution Group 

An alias you can send an email to and it gets sent to everyone in the DG

### Security Group

An alias you can give permissions to and access to a resource (like a file) is given to everyone in the SG
