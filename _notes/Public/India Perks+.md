India Perks+ is a budget provided to all [[Full Time Employee (FTE)]]

Yearly INR 30,000 budget for health-related things. This 30k figure can be topped up using [[Flex Points]] in the Benefits Asia portal.

### How to file a reimbursement

1. Go to the [India Perks+](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/hrw/Pages/perksplusindia.aspx) internal website. Note that different countries have different Perks+ programs, searching on Bing for Perks+ can show you the wrong site. Scroll to the "What's covered" section to see what you can purchase. Note down the section under which your purchase is covered - you'll need it in Step 5.
3. Purchase the item and pay for it using any payment method of your choice. Don't use the company Amex for this purpose. You need a bill that should be in your name.
4. Open the [EY Process Pay portal](https://aka.ms/eyprocesspay). Click on "Submit Reimbursement Claim" and then click the "Enter New Reimbursement Claim" link. From the "Select Claim Item" dropdown, pick "India Perks+ Program". You'll be able to see you remaining unclaimed balance for the year.
5. In the table, pick the "Claim for" category based on the sections in Step 1. Enter the bill number, bill date and amount as per the invoice. Hit "Submit". If the bill amount is larger than your remaining Perks+ balance, put in the full bill amount anyway, and the website will throw an error and explain how to file for a partial reimbursement up to your remaining balance.
