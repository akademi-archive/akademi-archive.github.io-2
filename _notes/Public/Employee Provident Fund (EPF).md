[HRweb - Provident Fund Description (sharepoint.com)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRw/Pages/PFDescIndia.aspx)  

The Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) is a government savings tool for the workforce. 12% of every employee's salary is invested directly into their EPF account, and an equal amount is contributed by the employer. You can check your EPF balance using the EPFO website or your Microsoft pay slip which can be found on the [[EY Portal]].

EPF contributions and the interest earned on them are exempt from tax. The interest rate for 2020-21 was 8.5% p.a. 

#### Universal account number (UAN)
UAN is a unique 12 digit number for your EPF account. It stays the same even if you change jobs. If you did not previously have a UAN, one will be generated for you when you join Microsoft.

#### PF Number
A new PF account number is generated every time an employee joins a new organization.

#### Withdrawing EPF Money
The money can be withdrawn at retirement, when you leave the company or [certain other conditions](https://cleartax.in/s/epf-withdrawal-online#pro).
