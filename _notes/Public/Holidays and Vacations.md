## Holiday calendar

You can check the holidays for your location on HR Web. [HRweb - Global Country Holidays (sharepoint.com)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/HRw/Pages/globalholidays.aspx)

## Taking time off

Microsoft employees can apply for leaves and check their balance using the MS Vacation tool. [MS Vacation - Home Page](https://msvacation/)

## Half days

Microsoft is quite flexible with work hours, so you generally don’t need to put in a request for a half day if you will be unavailable for a few hours. It’s sufficient to inform your team that you will be out for a bit.
