## Filing Expenses reports with MyExpense

[https://aka.ms/myexpense](https://aka.ms/myexpense)

You can submit expenses to be reimbursed using MyExpense. The tool is terrible, so if you find yourself confused, remember that you are a smart and capable person, and you will get it done eventually.

### What if I can’t see the expenses I made in MyExpense?

Any expenses made on your card will show up in the tool after 3-4 days. The process is not instant, so you will have to wait at least that long.

### Do I need to attach receipts?

Yes, one for each expense, even if the tool doesn’t show you the warning for smaller values. Make sure to save all your receipts! Digital PDF files work fine, otherwise you can scan a paper receipt and upload that. If you used your work Amex, the bill value must be exactly the same as the value on your card—sometimes when ordering online the restaurant will not account for Zomato/Swiggy discounts or tips and their bill value will be different.

Zomato sends you an email after every order that contains a link to an order summary, you can check your email for those if you ordered online.

### Interim and Final approver

The interim approver should be your team admin (Garima for NH44), the final approver should be the person your team admin reports to (Ankur for NH44).

### How do I get the money?

Once approved, Microsoft will pay the credit card bill directly.

### What if I don’t have a corporate card/didn’t use the card?

If you used a payment method other than your [Amex Corporate Card] to make expenses, you can manually add the expense and you’ll get the reimbursement in your next salary. Your team admin should be able to help with any clarifications.
