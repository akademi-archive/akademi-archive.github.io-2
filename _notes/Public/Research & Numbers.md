### OCV – One Customer Voice (Consolidated user feedback)

OCV puts customer feedback received across platforms into a single tool. Ask your PM to share OCV reports related to your products, and you will be able to keep an eye on what people are saying about your work area.  
  
P.S. You will need to jump through some hoops to enable OCV access, but steps to do so are explained reasonably well within the tool.

### Product Dashboards & Scorecards

Your product area may have a dashboard/scorecard that PMs will use to keep track of performance and usage metrics. Ask your PM for access.
