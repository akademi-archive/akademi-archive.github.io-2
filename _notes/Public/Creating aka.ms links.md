Go to [aka.ms](https://redirectiontool.trafficmanager.net/am/redirection/home?options=host:aka.ms&set=enableReadOnlyLinks) and click on the "New Link" button.

Put the link you want to shorten in the target URL field and enter the vanity name. For eg. if I make the Vanity name gyanl then opening aka.ms/gyanl will take me to the target URL.

You will need to add at least 1 other co-owner alias to create the link - but you can leave the security group alias field blank.
