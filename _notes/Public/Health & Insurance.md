The health care service provider attached Microsoft is **UnitedHealthcare Parekh Insurance** (UHCP).

### How to submit a claim

1.     Log into [UHCP Enrollment Portal (uhcpindia.com)](https://enrol.uhcpindia.com/#!/login) using your mobile number and OTP. The portal really likes to log you out, closing the tab and reopening means you will need to log in again.

2.     Go to domiciliary claims > Submit new claim

3.     Select plan and member, then fill out the other details. If your bill number is longer than 4 digits, use only the last 4 digits. This is not mentioned anywhere but the process will silently fail if you use an alphanumeric bill number or >4 digits. Hit submit (and hopefully it’ll work). You might get logged out.

4.     Download the cover sheet and merge it with all your supporting documents into a single PDF file. Do not use spaces in the name of the file. The portal only accepts a single PDF upload and won’t accept spaces.

5.     Go to domiciliary claims > View previous claims

6.     Upload your combined file into the portal and hit save

7.     Hope for the best. There is no confirmation other than a popup on the website.

8.     Didn’t work? Ask your team admin for the UHCP point of contact and ask them why. I don’t really know.
