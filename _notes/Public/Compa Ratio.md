Compa ratio is your annualized base salary (or hourly pay) divided by the midpoint of the salary range for your role. 

Note the Compa Ratio is a calculation used by managers and HR for statistical analysis, but it is not used to determine your pay, except in one-off cases involving complex transfers.

You can ask the AskHR Virtual Assistant "What is my Compa Ratio?" to know your Compa ratio.
