This stands for Employee Stock Purchase Program. If you choose to set it up, up to 15% (you can pick a lower amount as well) of your salary each month is deducted and you get Microsoft stock at a 10% discount (allocated quarterly, not every month). If you don’t have immediate expenses, it’s a good idea to set this up as Microsoft stock has generally performed well and is seen as a good investment.
