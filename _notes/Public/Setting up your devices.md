## Work Devices

Designers are issued a Macbook by default, but if you are working on an area requiring a Windows laptop, Android phone, iPhone or iPad to test apps, you can get in touch with your manager to request an additional device. Current global shortages mean that requests are taking longer than usual to fulfil.

## Company Portal (used to be Intune)

The company portal app is required on any device to access work resources. It sets up some additional security requirements on devices, so you might need to change your password to a more secure one when you set it up.

## Windows setup

Most things will just automatically work once you log in with your work id. See [Manage my device (sharepoint.com)](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/DeviceExperience/SitePages/Device%20Experience%20-%20Manage%20My%20Device.aspx) for more.

## Mac setup

Company portal for mac is being phased out in favor of apple business manager from March 2022. You may not need to do much to get things working, but check the link above for more details.

Global Protect VPN for MacA few internal sites (like [aka.ms/msvacation](aka.ms/msvacation), the vacation portal) will only work if you are connected to the Microsoft VPN or if you are connected to the Wi-Fi in the office. You may or may not need this app based on whether your device is already set up with Apple Business Manager.

## Android Work Profile (AWP)

If you use a personal or work-issued Android device, setting up the company portal will enable a “work profile” on your phone. This creates a second Play Store with a work icon, and any work apps (WXP, Outlook, Teams, etc.) will only let you sign in with your Microsoft ID if you download them through this version of the Play Store. Some phones will also allow you to disable notifications from all work apps after working hours, so this is a convenient way to keep your work and personal life separate.

## Software Licenses

You get a Figma license and access to M365 when you join the design team. Ask your manager or team admin if you require any other specific software licenses. There might be a license available on your team, or they may be able to acquire it for you.

## Figma

Figma and Figma mirror require you to use Login with SAML SSO, regular email and password will not work.
