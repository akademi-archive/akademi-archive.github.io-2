## Building access card

To get your Microsoft ID card, send an email toÂ GSAM India <DIOINDIA@microsoft.com> with your name, alias, employee ID, address, and phone number. They will ship the card to the office closest to you.

As of November 2021 there is a bit of a backlog so it is taking them a while to ship the cards, once you get an email confirmation about a ticket being raised, you can escalate it to potentially speed up the process.

Once you have your card, there is an activation process that should be outlined in an email. 

## Enabling access to additional buildings

Your card is set up for access only to the building you are assigned to, but if you need access to other buildings, follow these steps:

1. Go to GSAM Self Service Portal at [aka.ms/gsamssp](http://aka.ms/gsamssp).

2. Go to Asia from Select your Region

3. New Requests

4. Access Level Change Request

5. Add Std Access for each site you want to be able to visit, and keep the end date to less than a year from start date. You will get an error if you request access for more than a year.

This should enable access to the buildings you requested within a few hours.
