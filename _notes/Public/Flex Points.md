### What are flex points?

Each FTE gets 15,000 “flex points” every year, which can be used to increase the default insurance coverage on the Benefits Asia portal. Employees can add additional family members to their insurance or increase coverage amount.

Whatever points you have left after making your decision should be put into topping up the [[India Perks+]] benefit on the enrollment page (this won't happen automatically) and any unused points will expire end of FY. Each flex point put towards the India Perks+ benefit increases the amount reimbursable for the year by Re. 1


### Allocating flex points

Flex points can be allocated when a new employee joins, or during a set time of the year for other employees. You will receive an email with exact steps.
